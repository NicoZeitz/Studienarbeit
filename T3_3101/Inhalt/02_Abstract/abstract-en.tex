        This thesis deals with the development of a powerful computer game engine for the board game Patchwork, which works on the basis of a machine learning algorithm to open up the two-player game to the individual player and provide a strategically challenging experience. The work includes a game-theoretical analysis of the board game and the prototypical implementation as a computer game. The algorithms \acl{PVS}, \acl{MCTS} and AlphaZero are used as the basis for the implementation of the various more complex computer game opponents. The computer opponents are then compared with each other and with simpler comparison players, an opponent with random moves and an opponent based on a greedy algorithm. A simple user interface is implemented in the command line as a means of interacting with the computer game, and the concept and design for an intuitive, interactive user interface is described.
