  abstract  = {Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a new best-first search method that started a revolution in the field of Computer Go. Parallelizing MCTS is an important way to increase the strength of any Go program. In this article, we discuss three parallelization methods for MCTS: leaf parallelization, root parallelization, and tree parallelization. To be effective tree parallelization requires two techniques: adequately handling of (1) local mutexes and (2) virtual loss. Experiments in 13{\texttimes}13 Go reveal that in the program Mango root parallelization may lead to the best results for a specific time setting and specific program parameters. However, as soon as the selection mechanism is able to handle more adequately the balance of exploitation and exploration, tree parallelization should have attention too and could become a second choice for parallelizing MCTS. Preliminary experiments on the smaller 9{\texttimes}9 board provide promising prospects for tree parallelization.},

The classic full-board game-tree search paradigm has been powerless on Go even though this classic paradigm has produced programs with expert level performances in many other games. Three decades of research on knowledge and search did not push computer Go above intermediate amateur level. The emerging Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm is bringing an exciting breakthrough in computer Go toward challenging human experts, especially on smaller Go boards. This chapter gives an overview of both classical and MCTS approaches to computer Go.},

In particular, the principal variation splitting method has been implemented, and experimental results are presented which show how such refinements as progressive deepening, narrow window searching, and the use of memory tables affect the performance of multiprocessor based chess playing programs. When dealing with parallel processing systems, communication delays are perhaps the greatest source of lost time. Therefore, an implementation of our tree decomposition based algorithm is presented, one that operates with a modest amount of message passing within a network of processors. Since our system has low search overhead, the principal basis for comparison is the communication overhead, which in turn is shown to have two components.},
